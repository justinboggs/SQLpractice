-- To alleviate the issues with the abbreviations, we use a CASE statement
-- In this instance, we are using the CASE to match values in the PersonType column
-- the WHEN keyword tells SQL Server that "when" it finds 'SC' in the results
-- it should "then" change it in our displayed output to Store Contact
-- The ELSE statement is a default case when there is a value found that
-- doesn't match one of the WHEN clauses
-- Finish your CASE statement with the END keyword
-- Optionally use the AS keyword to indicate a column alias for the output
