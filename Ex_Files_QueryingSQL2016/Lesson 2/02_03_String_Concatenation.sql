-- Write a SELECT statement that returns a person's full name in a single column
-- This code contains logic errors due to the use of the commas
-- We typically separate column names with the comman in our SELECT satements
-- however, in this instance, we want to use concatenation.
-- This demonstrates a syntax error indicating that when we use concatenation
-- we don't separate the column names with commas
