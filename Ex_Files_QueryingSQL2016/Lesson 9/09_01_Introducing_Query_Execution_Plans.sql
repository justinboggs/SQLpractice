-- These are the simplest sub-queries to work with as they return a single
-- value for use in the outer query.
-- Here we ask for the quantity ordered and the total sale value
-- for the item in the SalesOrderDetail table that has the lowest unit price
-- The subquery can also be executed separately.  Highlight it and run that portion

-- Use a subquery that returns multiple values
-- In this case, we cannot use the = operator
-- but instead will use the IN clause due to multiple
-- values being returned.
-- Here we look for the first and last name of sales people
-- who have had sales last year that exceeded $2M
