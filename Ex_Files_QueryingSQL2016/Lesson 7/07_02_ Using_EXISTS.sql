-- We do this by using EXISTS to check which records in the subquery,
-- in this case the SalesOrderHeader table, match the customer IDs and that also have
-- the online order flag set to 1.
-- We might run such a query to determine which customers place online orders so that
-- we can send them specials or other notification types.
