-- used on the first name only as opposed to first then last.

-- Change the order of the records by ordering the results alphabetically
-- based on the first name and then last name but in this instance, 
-- do not use the field name but rather use the ordinal positions 
-- to show how the results sort.
-- NOTE, this is not a good practice and is only demonstrated for awareness

-- Change the order of the records by ordering the results
-- based on the BusinessEntityID that isn't included in the output
-- to show that the order is still applied even though the field
-- is not included in the result list.  It's also hard to tell how
-- the order was factored so this could cause confusion in the results.

-- Change the order of the records by ordering the results alphabetically
-- based on the middle name to show how the NULL impacts the results.
-- NULL affects the results because it is unknown and will show up in the results
-- ahead of any other value.
